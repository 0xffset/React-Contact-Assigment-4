### Fourth Web Programming Assignment  (Contact WebAPI Consumption using ReactJS)

This is assignment #4 about how to consume a service using WebAPI using ReactJS as part of my fourth web programming appointment. To see the webpage running, you should click [here](https://contacts-react-assignment-four.netlify.app/) to see previsualization.

### Disclaimer 
This project deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and PHP. Why? Foremost, Netlify has a free-not-cost deployment platform of at least 100 GB of the store to deploy projects, so it’s useful for this kind of assignment. The easy integration of those kinds of projects makes Netlify a good option, and the easy ReactJS app deployment as well.
